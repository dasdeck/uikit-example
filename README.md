# UIkit-example

Some example on how to integrate UIkit into your projects.

Currently webpack only.

Run `npm i` to install, run `npm run watch` to build. 
Open the example at `examples/index.html`.

NOTE:

In order to get the "separate" examples working, UIkit has to be built.
Type `npm run install:build` to compile UIkit inside it's node_modules folder.
This creates the files neccesary
for the extended examples.
These files are not (yet) distributed inside the npm package.

## TODO

[ ] bundle css with typescript
