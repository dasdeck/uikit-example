# UIkit-example

Some example on how to integrate UIkit into your projects.

Currently webpack only.

Run `npm i` to install, run `npm run watch` to build. 
Open the example at `examples/index.html`.

NOTE:

The install script will also install and compile UIkit inside it's node_modules folder as some files
for the extended examples are not distributed inside the npm package.

## TODO

[ ] bundle css with typescript
